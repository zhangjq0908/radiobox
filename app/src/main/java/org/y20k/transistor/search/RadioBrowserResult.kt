JSON Struct Station
https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/

changeuuid          UUID 	                            A globally unique identifier for the change of the station information
stationuuid 	    UUID 	                            A globally unique identifier for the station

This link is especially usefull if you use this API from a platform that is not able to do a resolve on its own (e.g. JavaScript in browser) or you just don't want to invest the time in decoding playlists yourself.

lastchangetime      datetime, YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss       Last time when the stream information was changed in the database
codec               string                              The codec of this stream recorded at the last check.
bitrate          	number, integer, bps             	The bitrate of this stream recorded at the last check.
